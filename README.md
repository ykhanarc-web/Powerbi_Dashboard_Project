Weekly Point-of-Sale (POS) Transaction Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

DATA ANALYST PROJECTS
1. Weekly Point-of-Sale (POS) Transaction Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

•	Goal: Designed and deployed an interactive, one-page Power BI dashboard to transform raw, weekly POS transaction data from the Saudi Central Bank (SAMA) into actionable business insights.

•	Process & Tools: Performed end-to-end ETL using Power Query to clean, structure, and standardize raw PDF/Excel data, removing inconsistencies and creating custom consumer categories.

•	DAX & Modeling: Developed a robust Data Model and created key performance indicators (KPIs) and complex calculations using DAX (Total Transaction Value, Average Transaction Value, Week-wise/Category-wise calculations).

•	Key Insights: Identified Food & Dining as the largest contributor to transaction value and noted that Week 4 recorded the highest total transaction value, leading to insights on consumer activity and spending patterns.

•	Outcome: Converted a raw data source into a quick-insight tool that highlights weekly trends, identifies top/low-performing categories, and enables week-by-week comparison using slicers.
